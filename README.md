# Spring Boot Backend Template

A production-ready, extensible backend boilerplate built with Java and Spring Boot — designed to save developers hours of setup time when building full-stack applications.

This template provides a secure, scalable, and modular starting point with built-in authentication, role management, database migrations, and common backend utilities. It’s ideal for solo developers, rapid prototyping, or small teams looking to kickstart backend development without reinventing the wheel.

## Features

### **Authentication & Security**
- JWT-based authentication with access/refresh token flows
- OTP token support (e.g., for email verification, password resets)
- Multi-device session management
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with a flexible roles system
- Rate limiting using **Bucket4j** (per-IP request throttling)

### **Architecture & Code Design**
- Modular RESTful API design using Spring Boot
- Repository abstraction with **Spring Data JPA**
- DTOs for request/response encapsulation
- Entity relationships and querying via JPA

### **Database & Migrations**
- **Flyway** SQL scripts for database versioning and pre-initialized schema
- Tables for:
  - `Users`
  - `Tokens`
  - `TokenType`
  - `UserRoles`
  - `Documents`
  - `Collections`
- Default seed data (optional, can be modified)

### **Auth Flows**
- Signup with email verification
- Login
- Forgot password / password reset
- Email verification

### **Scheduled Tasks**
- Cron jobs for cleanup and token/database maintenance (e.g., delete expired tokens)

### **Logging**
- Centralized and configurable logging using **Log4j2**

## Use Case

This template provides developers with a solid starting point for building backend services in full-stack applications. You can customize and extend it to fit your project needs. Whether you're building a mobile app, a web dashboard, or an internal tool, this backend gives you:

- A working JWT auth system out of the box
- Basic role-based access to endpoints
- Predefined base models and clean architecture to build on
- A time-saving alternative to building everything from scratch

## TODO / Roadmap

This project is still a work-in-progress. While it’s fully functional for many use cases, several important improvements and additions are planned to be made in the future:

### Core Improvements
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline setup (e.g., GitHub Actions for build/test/lint)
- [ ] Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` for containerized local development
- [ ] Environment variable management (e.g., Spring profiles + `.env` support)

### Documentation
- [ ] Setup guide and installation steps
- [ ] API documentation (via Swagger or Postman collection)
- [ ] Example curl/Postman requests for:
  - Login / Signup
  - Refresh token flow
  - OTP verification
- [ ] Developer notes (how to extend models, write migrations, etc.)

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests (e.g., for auth, token flows, rate limiting)
- [ ] Mocking examples for repository/service layers

### Additional Features
- [ ] Pagination, filtering, and sorting for REST endpoints
- [ ] Soft delete support for key models (e.g., users, documents)
- [ ] Auditing fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by, etc.)
- [ ] Optional multi-tenancy support (for org-based apps)
- [ ] Make rate limiting easily configurable or optional
- [ ] Modularize core features for easier enabling/disabling

## Getting Started (Coming Soon)

Documentation and setup steps will be added here once the project is closer to version 1.0.
